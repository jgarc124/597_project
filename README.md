Abstract
In this project, we researched if it was possible to reduce bias while increasing the accuracy score for predicting a personâ€™s chances of recidivating. To do this, we produced two pairs of models, where Race/Ethnicity was used as a feature in one model to see if it played a role in determining recidivism. The first set of models that were developed were decision tree models and the second set of models were multinomial logistic regression models. We use data from the state of Iowa and Georgia from the last fifteen years to combine a diverse dataset for training and testing. Our findings indicate that there is little to no bias between both sets of models, so Race and Ethnicity play an insignificant role in predicting recidivism. Moreover, the models that were produced are interpretable and achieve high accuracy and precision rates.
